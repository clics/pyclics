    ----
    Colexifications are identified using a hash (Python dictionary) and a
    linear iteration through the graph. As a result, this approach is very
    fast, yet the results are potentially a bit counter-intuitive, as they are
    presented as a dictionary containing word values as keys. To get all
    colexifications in sets, however, you can just take the values of the
    dictionary.
